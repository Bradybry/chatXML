# Introducing ChatXML: A Beginner's Guide to Highly Structured Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering has captured the world's imagination since the release of ChatGPT, as people realized they can make meaninful contributions to humanity's understanding of the most power AI systems in the world, without needing a PhD. Companies like Anthropic are offering $300K plus salaries to wizards who claim to have tamed the beast that are LLMs. However, without a standardized methodology, prompt engineering remains an ethereal art form. Prompters tout secret techniques and "special sauces" that just look like adjective spaghetti to me. There lacks any method of comparing or improving these approaches.  **At the moment, prompt engineering is an artform closer to alchemy than chemistry.**

ChatXML does not pretend to solve prompt engineering once and for all. But by providing structure and standards, ChatXML aims to systematically improve the art and inch it closer to a science. ChatXML offers a simple yet powerful framework for defining a chatbot's behavior, responses, and conversational flow using a familiar XML format. By following this consistent schema, conversational AI engineers can create complex agents in a clear, standardized, and reproducible way.

* Offer an unambiguous, human-readable format for prompt engineering and chatbot development.

* Facilitate rapid experimentation by making these tools accessible to engineers of all skill levels.

* Enable collaborative development through a shared set of standards and best practices.

* Produce conversational agents that are more consistent, scalable, and aligned with user expectations.

This tutorial will introduce you to the ChatXML format and show how it can be used to build engaging conversational experiences with today's AI technologies. Whether you're an expert in natural language processing or just getting started with conversational UI, ChatXML provides a versatile framework to design, develop, and improve virtual agents of all kinds.

ChatXML is not an original idea. In fact, OpenAI has hinted that this is a potential direction for steerability in their release of ChatML which I see as an early version of a complete ChatXML. Anthropic prompt design manual also recommends leverage XML-like tags. Due to the massive volume of markdown that LLMs have been trained on, they seem to have strong abilities at parsing and extracting context from XML-like formats. If OpenAI and Anthropic continue fine-tuning or RLHFing models to leverage XML-like prompts, we can expect this methodology to continue to get better performance out of newer models.  


## ChatXML: Formatting and Grammar for Defining an Assistant's Behavior

Below is a template for defining an assistant's behavior using ChatXML:

```xml
<assistant_definition>
  <name>Assistant_Name</name>
  <role>Assistant's role and purpose</role>
  <guidelines_optional>
    <guideline>Guideline 1</guideline>
    <guideline>Guideline 2</guideline>
    <guideline>Guideline 3</guideline>
  </guidelines_optional>
  <system_message>Initial response from the assistant after assuming the new definition</system_message>
  <examples>
    <example>
      <user_input>Example user input 1</user_input>
      <assistant_response>Example assistant response 1</assistant_response>
    </example>
    <example>
      <user_input>Example user input 2</user_input>
      <assistant_response>Example assistant response 2</assistant_response>
    </example>
  </examples>
  <optional_attributes>
    <attribute>
      <name>Attribute_Name</name>
      <value>Attribute_Value</value>
    </attribute>
  </optional_attributes>
</assistant_definition>
```
WARNING: If you include hallucinations in your examples, you are basically encouraging the model to hallucinate. Be careful and cognizant.

## Example Usage:

To implement ChatXML, you can provide the following first message to chatGPT for example:

```
Please assume the role of the following agent definition and respond using the ChatXML schema demonstrated within the definition.

<assistant_definition>
    {Include rest of definition}
</assistant_definition>

Respond with your system message if you understand and have assumed the assistant_definition.
```
You should get the system message verbatim, after which you can interact with the assistant as if it were the assistant that was defined.


## Prompt Generator Use Case
To get started I suggest starting with following prompt definition generator. I use this in combination with my prompt proposal generator (focused on brainstorming) to generate pretty much all my prompts. Even thought it has huge room for improvement, it is incredibly useful and already 10x the prompter that I am alone. 

GPT-4 is currently the best at this with Claude-v1.3 being a close second. Ultimately it doesn't matter. In this example, I tell GPT-4 that it is Claue and it doesn't mind pretending to be Claude at all. 

```xml
<assistant_definition>
  <name>Prompt_Generator</name>
  <role>Generates agent definitions tailored for Anthropic's AI Claude based on user requests</role>
  <guidelines_optional>
    <guideline>Agent definitions aim to be concise yet clear</guideline>
    <guideline>Define terms and concepts to establish scope and set proper expectations</guideline>
    <guideline>Analyze user requests and goals to determine appropriate prompt responses</guideline>
  </guidelines_optional>
  <system_message>I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I generate agent definitions tailored to your needs. Please describe what type of prompt you would like me to generate along with any requirements or specifications that I should consider.</system_message>
  <examples>
    <example>
      <user_input>Design a prompt for Claude to help users compose thoughtful emails.</user_input>
      <assistant_response>
        <assistant_definition>
          <name>EmailComposer</name>
          <role>Helps users draft thoughtful emails by analyzing intent and suggesting how to compose a helpful, courteous message</role>
          <guidelines_optional>
            <guideline>Determine how to best respond based on requested intent</guideline>
            <guideline>Assist with scheduling invitations, politely declining requests, asking questions, or conveying information</guideline>
          </guidelines_optional>
          <system_message>You are Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to help users draft emails. Please describe your intent and goal for the email. I will suggest how to compose a helpful, courteous message to achieve that goal.</system_message>
          <examples>
            <example>
              <user_input>I need to email my professor to request an extension on my final paper due to health issues.</user_input>
              <assistant_response>
                Here is a draft:
                Dear [Professor's Name],

                I hope you are having a good week. I am writing to request an extension on the deadline for my final paper due this Friday. I have had some health issues arise recently that have delayed my work on the paper. The health center has given me medication that should help resolve the issues, however, the recovery time is resulting in extra challenges. I was hoping you might consider allowing me an additional 4-5 days to complete and submit the paper if possible. Please let me know if this extension can be granted or if we can discuss alternate arrangements.

                I appreciate your understanding and willingness to be flexible during this time. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.

                All the best,
                [Your Name]
              </assistant_response>
            </example>
          </examples>

Notice the hallucinations of links and filenames be sure to provide that information in the user input or check it when you get generations. I think I like to do is add a \<codebase>\</codebase> or \<context>\<context> tag around big data dumps. You can also improve performance just by giving the assistant attributes like honesty, rigor, etc which all can have subtle improvements on performance.


# Conclusion

The ChatXML methodology is offered in the hopes that innovative prompt engineers may adopt and build upon it. While almost any prompt engineering approach appears to yield some success today, it is difficult to determine what truly works and why. By introducing structure and standards, ChatXML aims to enable new ways of evaluating and improving prompt performance. **Only through rigorous methods can we hope to advance prompt engineering from mystical art to technological science.** The goal isn't to limit creativity, it's to provide some kind of structure to understand it.
