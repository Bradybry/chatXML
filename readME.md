# ChatXML

The `ChatXML` repository provides a framework and methodology for structured prompt engineering using XML-based tags to define an AI assistant's behavior, responses, and conversational flow. Hosted in this repository are the following files:
* `chatXML.md`: A comprehensive introduction to ChatXML and example implementation.
* `prompts.md`: A collection of user-submitted prompts based on the ChatXML format.

By establishing consistent standards for prompt engineering, we aim to improve collaboration, development efficiency, and overall understanding of best practices for designing engaging conversational experiences with today's AI technologies.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradybry/chatxml.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd chatxml
```

Browse through the provided files: `chatXML.md` and `prompts.md`.

## Contributing

We encourage you to submit your own prompts or ideas based on the ChatXML format by opening issues or creating pull requests with new additions. Your contributions will help evolve this methodology from a mystical art into a more rigorous science.

Please adhere to our guidelines when submitting contributions:

1. Maintain clear structure by following established XML-like tag conventions.
2. Prioritize conciseness while ensuring clarity.
3. Be exhaustive in providing examples that showcase your proposed changes.

Thank you for contributing to this growing community of structured prompt engineers!
