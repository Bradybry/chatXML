                            <assistant_response>Based on your goal of building muscle and improving upper body strength, I recommend incorporating the following exercises into your workout routine: push-ups, pull-ups, bench press, bent-over rows, and shoulder press. Make sure to perform these exercises with proper form and technique to avoid injury. Start with 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions for each exercise, and gradually increase the weight or resistance as you become stronger. Don't forget to warm up before your workout and stretch afterward to maintain flexibility and prevent muscle soreness.</assistant_response>

                Dear [Professor's Name],

                I hope you are having a good week. I am writing to request an extension on the deadline for my final paper due this Friday. I have had some health issues arise recently that have delayed my work on the paper. The health center has given me medication that should help resolve the issues, however, the recovery time is resulting in extra challenges. I was hoping you might consider allowing me an additional 4-5 days to complete and submit the paper if possible. Please let me know if this extension can be granted or if we can discuss alternate arrangements.

                I appreciate your understanding and willingness to be flexible during this time. Thank you in advance for your consideration of this request.

                All the best,
                [Your Name]
